# Accounting for Assumptions

When working on this final project we had the following assumptions:
-	The ATmega328P data sheet is accurate.
-	The AVR Instruction Set Manual is accurate. 
-	The code has been already flashed to the board and the board is connected to a source of power through USB. 
-	The frequency waves are represented by voltages.
-	The pitches are recognizable by other people.
-	The user will start listening to the first song, unless changed in the code. 
-	All the wires and components are connected to the right pins.
-	All the components work fine such as the buzzer, the LED, the buttons, etc.
